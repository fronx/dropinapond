## Critical Issues by Priority

### ‚úÖ FIXED - Critical Issues (Completed 2025-10-24)

#### 1. CLAUDE.md - Kernel Methods Misrepresentation ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Claimed system "operates on kernel-weighted neighborhoods instead of discrete clusters"

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed claims about kernel methods being implemented
- Updated to describe actual v0.2 discrete clustering approach
- Fixed function names (load_ego_graph not load_ego_from_json)
- Corrected example count (15 people, not 8)
- Updated design principles to clarify planned vs implemented
- Removed outdated line number references

**Result**: Now accurately reflects v0.2 implementation

#### 2. V02_MIGRATION.md - False Backward Compatibility ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Falsely claimed "system still supports v0.1 format"

**Fix Applied**:
- Added "Breaking Changes" section stating v0.2 is NOT backward compatible
- Updated to show modular directory structure (not monolithic JSON)
- Fixed all API examples to use correct load_ego_graph() function
- Updated migration path to reflect manual process
- Corrected data format examples with all fields

**Result**: Now honest about breaking changes

#### 3. ARCHITECTURE.md - Wrong Data Format ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Showed embeddings stored in JSON instead of ChromaDB

**Fix Applied**:
- Replaced monolithic JSON examples with modular directory structure
- Showed embeddings stored in ChromaDB (not in JSON)
- Added "Current v0.2" vs "Planned v0.3" sections throughout
- Fixed edge format (scalar actual, not object)
- Updated metric descriptions to show discrete clustering is current
- Removed prediction_confidence and is_self fields

**Result**: Data format examples now match actual implementation

#### 4. docs/INDEX.md - Understated Progress ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Project status said "Core metrics working" when v0.2 has much more

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated project status to accurately reflect v0.2 accomplishments
- Moved conversational interface from "planned" to "current"
- Added visual interface, analysis export, and other v0.2 features
- Correctly lists implemented vs planned for v0.3

**Result**: Now accurately represents project maturity

#### 5. CONVERSATIONAL_INTERFACE.md - Wrong File Structure ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Showed monolithic JSON format instead of modular structure

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed specific file structure details
- Replaced with conceptual data model (what's stored, not how)
- Added link to .claude/commands/ego-session.md for implementation
- Focused on user-facing concepts

**Result**: Now storage-agnostic and accurate

#### 6. docs/VISION.md - Checked ‚úÖ
**Issue**: Suspected technical storage details

**Fix Applied**: Reviewed and confirmed already appropriately abstract
- Only mentions "JSON" in passing
- Focused on UX and concepts, not implementation
- No changes needed

**Result**: Already good, no action required

---

### üî¥ REMAINING CRITICAL - Needs Status Banners

#### CONTINUOUS_FIELDS.md - Aspirational Document Mislabeled
**Issue**: Entire document describes kernel-based continuous fields in present tense

**Reality**: System uses discrete clustering, phrase-level embeddings exist but kernel methods don't

**Impact**: Readers believe v0.3 features are implemented

**Recommended Fix**: Add prominent banner: "‚ö†Ô∏è This describes PLANNED v0.3+ architecture"

---

### üü° HIGH PRIORITY (Should Fix Soon)

#### 5. IMPLEMENTATION.md - Outdated Version Status
**Issue**: Says "What Works Now (v0.1)" when system is at v0.2

**Reality**: Major v0.2 features implemented:
- Modular directory format
- ChromaDB integration
- Conversational interface
- 15-person example (not 8)

**Fix**: Update to "What Works Now (v0.2)" with accurate feature list

#### 6. TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS.md - Complete Decay System Not Implemented
**Issue**: Documents `update_ego_graph()` function with exponential decay (lines 38-88)

**Reality**:
- Function doesn't exist (grep confirms)
- Timestamps captured but never used for decay
- Weights are static

**Impact**: ~95% of document is aspirational

**Fix**: Add status banner, create "Current v0.2" vs "Planned v0.3" sections

#### 7. docs/INDEX.md - Understates Progress
**Issue**: Project status says "Current: Core metrics working, example fixture, command-line analysis"

**Reality**: Much more is implemented:
- Full v0.2 with modular format
- ChromaDB integration
- GUI (React + D3)
- Conversational interface
- Analysis export

**Fix**: Update project status section with accurate v0.2 feature list

#### 8. CONVERSATIONAL_INTERFACE.md - Wrong File Structure
**Issue**: Shows monolithic JSON format (lines 94-131)

**Reality**: v0.2 uses modular directory structure:
```
data/ego_graphs/name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ self.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ connections/*.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ edges.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contact_points.json
```

**Fix**: Replace entire file structure section

---

### üü¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY

#### 9. docs/VISION.md - Data Format Examples Outdated
**Issue**: Shows old data format with embeddings in JSON, wrong edge structure

**Fix**: Update examples to match v0.2 modular format

#### 10. VISION.md (root) - Similar Issues
**Issue**: Same data format problems as docs/VISION.md

**Fix**: Sync with docs/VISION.md updates

#### 11. docs/REFINEMENTS.md - Implementation Clarity
**Issue**: Doesn't distinguish documented refinements from implemented ones

**Fix**: Add implementation status indicators

---

## What's Actually Implemented (v0.2)

### ‚úÖ Data Layer
- Modular directory format (metadata.json, self.json, connections/*.json, edges.json, contact_points.json)
- ChromaDB integration with sentence-transformers
- Phrase-level semantic fields (text, weight, last_updated)
- all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings (384 dimensions)
- Automatic embedding computation and caching
- Weighted mean embeddings computed on-demand

- Field translation via local gradients
- Continuous field differentials

### ‚ùå Temporal Dynamics
- Exponential phrase weight decay (œÑ ‚âà 40 days)
- Edge weight decay
- `update_ego_graph()` function

- Prediction confidence tracking
- Active inference loop
- Inter-node protocol
- Projected mutual predictability (still uses cosine similarity)

---

## Detailed Findings by File

### CLAUDE.md

**Accuracy Score: 70/100**

**Critical Inaccuracies:**
1. **Kernel methods claim** (lines 58, 66): States "operates on kernel-weighted neighborhoods" but uses discrete clustering (greedy modularity)
2. **Storage functions** (lines 77-79): Documents `load_ego_from_json()` and `load_ego_from_modular()` which don't exist; only `load_ego_graph()` exists
3. **Example fixture count** (line 201): Claims "8 people" but fronx has 15
4. **Line number references** (lines 239, 241): Completely outdated (file is 996 lines, not ~680)
5. **Backward compatibility** (line 204): Claims compatibility with v0.1 but this was removed

**Recommended Fixes:**
- Add disclaimer about kernel methods being planned v0.3+
- Correct function names in storage.py section
- Update example fixture count to 15
- Remove specific line number references
- Remove backward compatibility claims

---

### V02_MIGRATION.md

**Accuracy Score: 50/100**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **FALSE backward compatibility** (lines 104-112): Claims v0.1 support exists when it was explicitly removed in commit e05ce2a
2. **Wrong format** (lines 64-91): Describes monolithic JSON when actual v0.2 uses modular directory structure
3. **Wrong API** (lines 52-62): Documents `load_ego_from_json()` which doesn't exist
4. **Validation example** (lines 94-101): References abandoned monolithic validator

**Reality:**
- v0.2 is directory-based: metadata.json, self.json, connections/*.json, edges.json, contact_points.json
- Only `load_ego_graph()` exists in storage.py
- No v0.1 support anywhere in codebase
- Migration path is theoretical, no implementation

**Recommended Actions:**
- Add "Breaking Changes" section stating v0.2 is NOT backward compatible
- Rewrite entire JSON format section for modular structure
- Fix all code examples to use correct API
- Consider renaming to "V02_FORMAT.md" since migration is impossible

---

### ARCHITECTURE.md

**Accuracy Score: 60/100**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Data format wrong** (lines 7-72): Shows embeddings stored in JSON; actually in ChromaDB
2. **Edge format wrong** (lines 63-70): Shows `"actual": {"present": 0.3}` but actual is scalar `"actual": 0.7`
3. **Clustering method** (lines 133-142): Claims spectral clustering, actually uses greedy modularity
4. **Kernel methods** (lines 125-172): Entire section describes unimplemented future architecture
5. **Public legibility** (lines 174-214): Claims kernel weighting but uses uniform weights
6. **Translation** (lines 291-338): Claims gradients but uses centroid differences

**Missing Documentation:**
- ChromaDB architecture details
- Mean embedding computation
- Phrase similarity analysis
- Orientation score breakdowns
- Analysis JSON export
- Visualization features

**Recommended Fix:**
Add clear "Current Implementation (v0.2)" vs "Future Architecture (v0.3+)" sections throughout

---

### CONTINUOUS_FIELDS.md

**Accuracy Score: 5/100**

**Status:** Almost entirely aspirational roadmap mislabeled as current documentation

**What's Accurate:**
- Phrase-level data structure exists (text, weight, last_updated)
- ChromaDB storage confirmed
- No embeddings in JSON (correct)

**What's Wrong:**
- Claims "operates on kernel-weighted neighborhoods" - doesn't exist
- Documents Gaussian kernel density - not implemented
- Shows kernel-weighted reconstruction - not implemented
- Claims semantic gradients - uses centroid differences
- On-demand clustering - clusters computed once and stored

**Reality Check:**
- storage.py line 191-197: Computes mean embeddings
- ego_ops.py line 806: Uses discrete clustering
- ego_ops.py line 457: Uses centroid differences for translation

**Recommended Action:**
Add prominent banner: "‚ö†Ô∏è This describes PLANNED v0.3+ architecture. Current v0.2 uses discrete clustering."

---

### TEMPORAL_DYNAMICS.md

**Accuracy Score: 5/100**

**Status:** ~95% aspirational, no temporal decay implemented

**What's Accurate:**
- Phrase structure with `last_updated` field exists
- Timestamps are captured in data

**What's Wrong - Everything Else:**
- `update_ego_graph()` function - doesn't exist
- Exponential decay computation - not implemented
- Re-mention weight bumping - not implemented
- Phrase pruning - not implemented
- Edge temporal structure (past/present/future) - wrong format, actual is scalar
- Prediction confidence - field doesn't exist
- Boost strategies - not implemented
- Semantic velocity - not implemented
- Oscillation detection - not implemented

**Evidence:**
- grep for "update_ego_graph" returns nothing
- No decay computation in storage.py or ego_ops.py
- `last_updated` timestamps read but never used
- Actual edge format: `"actual": 0.7` (scalar, not object)

**Recommended Action:**
Add status banner, reframe entire document as v0.3+ specification

---

### IMPLEMENTATION.md

**Accuracy Score: 40/100**

**Critical Issues:**
1. **Version wrong** (lines 5-18): Says "v0.1" is current, actually at v0.2
2. **Example fixture** (line 16): References non-existent `fronx.json` file; actual is `fronx/` directory
3. **"What's Next" outdated** (lines 20-39): Lists already-implemented features as planned
4. **Code structure** (lines 106-157): Wrong file locations, wrong line numbers, wrong function names
5. **ChromaDB section** (lines 257-341): Shows how to set up what's already set up
6. **Roadmap** (lines 588-609): Says v0.2 is "next" when it's current

**What's Actually Implemented:**
- v0.2 with modular format
- ChromaDB with sentence-transformers
- Conversational interface (/ego-session)
- Analysis export
- Visualization
- 15-person example

**Recommended Fix:**
Complete rewrite of status sections, remove all specific line numbers, document actual v0.2 state

---

### docs/INDEX.md

**Accuracy Score: 75/100**

**Main Issue: Project Status Severely Understated**

**Current Documentation Says:**
```markdown
**Current**: Core metrics working, example fixture, command-line analysis
**Next**: Conversational interface, embedding pipeline, temporal dynamics
```

**Reality:**
```markdown
**Current (v0.2)**:
- All six navigation metrics with phrase-level embeddings
- Modular directory format with ChromaDB
- Visual interface (React + D3)
- Conversational interface (/ego-session)
- Analysis export
- Translation hints

**Planned (v0.3+)**:
- Kernel-based neighborhoods
- Temporal dynamics
- Active inference loop
```

**Missing References:**
- V02_MIGRATION.md not mentioned
- GUI not mentioned
- Modular format not explained

**Recommended Fix:**
Update project status section, add GUI to quick start, reference V02_MIGRATION.md

---

### CONVERSATIONAL_INTERFACE.md

**Accuracy Score: 70/100**

**Critical Issue: Wrong File Structure (Lines 94-131)**

**Documentation Shows:**
Single JSON file: `data/ego_graphs/{name}.json`

**Reality:**
Modular directory:
```
data/ego_graphs/{name}/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ self.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ connections/*.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ edges.json
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ contact_points.json
```

**Other Issues:**
- Metadata format wrong (nested vs flat)
- Missing `capabilities`, `availability`, `notes` fields
- Missing `channels` field on edges
- Claims "opens in browser" but uses matplotlib desktop window

**What's Accurate:**
- `/ego-session` command exists and works
- ChromaDB integration correct
- Analysis command correct
- Workflow description accurate

**Recommended Fix:**
Replace entire file structure section with accurate modular format

---

### docs/VISION.md & VISION.md (root)

**Accuracy Score: 65/100**

**Issues:**
- Data format examples don't match v0.2 modular structure
- Shows embeddings in JSON (actually in ChromaDB)
- Edge format wrong (shows `{"present": 0.3}` instead of scalar)
- Embedding dimension wrong (says "5-100 dims", actually 384)
- Clustering method wrong (claims spectral, uses greedy modularity)
- Example dataset stats wrong (8 people, actually 15)
- Missing embedding computation script reference (no script needed, automatic)

**What's Accurate:**
- High-level vision and concepts
- Privacy model
- Six metrics conceptual framework
- Use cases

**Recommended Fix:**
Update all data format examples to v0.2 modular format, fix technical details

---

### docs/REFINEMENTS.md

**Accuracy Score: 60/100**

**Issue:** Unclear Implementation Status

**What's Actually Implemented:**
- Phrase-level semantic fields ‚úÖ
- Modular directory format ‚úÖ
- Rank-2 attunement (code exists) ‚úÖ

**What's NOT Implemented (Claimed as Implemented):**
- Prediction confidence tracking ‚ùå
- Projected mutual predictability ‚ùå
- Legibility threshold gating ‚ùå
- Active inference loop ‚ùå
- Temporal decay ‚ùå

**Recommended Fix:**
Add implementation status indicators to each section

## Documentation Patterns to Avoid

### ‚ùå Bad: Present Tense for Future Features
```markdown
The system uses kernel-weighted neighborhoods...
```

### ‚úÖ Good: Clear Status Indicators
```markdown
**PLANNED v0.3**: The system will use kernel-weighted neighborhoods...

**CURRENT v0.2**: The system uses discrete clustering...
```

### ‚ùå Bad: Specific Line Numbers
```markdown
See ego_ops.py lines 621-680 for implementation
```

### ‚úÖ Good: Function References
```markdown
See `orientation_score_breakdowns()` function in ego_ops.py
```

### ‚ùå Bad: Theoretical Code as Real
```python
# Shows function that doesn't exist
ego = load_ego_from_json("graph.json")
```

### ‚úÖ Good: Actual Working Code
```python
# Actual API
from src.storage import load_ego_graph
from src.embeddings import get_embedding_service

service = get_embedding_service()
ego = load_ego_graph("data/ego_graphs/fronx", service)
```
